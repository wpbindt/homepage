<p>
In Ansible, trying to copy a directory and its subdirectories to the server as follows:
<pre>
- name: Copy directory and all its contents and subdirectories
  copy:
    src: local/directory/
    dest: /server/directory/
    owner: root
    group: root
</pre>
doesn't work. Instead, use Ansible <code>synchronize</code> module, which is a wrapper around <code>rsync</code>. It works like this:
<pre>
- name: Copy directory and all its contents and subdirectories
  synchronize:
    src: local/directory/
    dest: /server/directory/
    delete: yes
</pre>
The delete option removes remote files if they don't exist in the source.
