Today I learned that static sites need TLS too. I always thought it's just for dynamic sites dealing with sensitive information like credit card information or credentials, but apparently some serious harm can be done using just static content too. Without TLS, a MITM attack would be able to replace any of your static content. For example, some javascript which runs a crypto miner. </p>
